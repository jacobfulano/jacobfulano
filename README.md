I am a computational neuroscientist interested in developing experimentally motivated, mathematically grounded theories of neural systems. Some of my neuroscience work can be found [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rbehnialab).

I am also a ML Research Intern for [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com/).

I like it when neuroscience inspires AI!
